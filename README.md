# GameDevProj2

This was our final game created for my Game Dev 1 class during the fall of 2022. While it is only the second larger scale game I made it is, by far, my favorite. This is due to the fact that I created the music and particle effects myself. I also led much of the game design and direction. I served as group leader for this project in a group with 2 others.
